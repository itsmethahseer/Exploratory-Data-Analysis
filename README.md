# Titanic EDA Project

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for beginners in data science and machine learning, as it provides a good opportunity to practice data cleaning, visualization, and analysis techniques.

## Overview

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not, their age, class, and other attributes. The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth EDA to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file)).  The columns in the dataset include:

- PassengerId
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket (Ticket number)
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (Port of embarkation)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/itsmethahseer/Exploratory-Data_Analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd EDA
```

3. Set up the Python environment with the required dependencies. You can do this using `virtualenv` or `conda`.

4. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `EDA.ipynb` in the directory.

## Usage

The Jupyter notebook contains the EDA process, including data loading, cleaning, visualization, and analysis. Each section is documented with explanations and comments to guide you through the process.
